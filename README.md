# Regex-Parser
# Why ?
To understand about parser/syntax tree

```
The AstNode is not necessarily needed for validating regex only.
Not all possible operations implemented

Drawback - so many sequential nodes!

Future hope - Will try to implement the RegexMatcher later
```
# Description
Extended work of Automaton- solver.Implemented a very basic regular expression parser. Although it doesn't support all the operations possible.Was motivated by regex matcher at linux system.Implementing full library by own is quite a complex task.Yet i gave a try and still i am working to improve.
# Limitations
```
- Limitaions with multiple OR operations!
- Doesn't support all
